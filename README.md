Stellar Odyssey Eternals is our first game created in Unity in a top-down view.
Among other things, enemy movement has been implemented in it: patrols and player tracking.
A unique mechanic is bullet time, activated on the spacebar, slows down time, but the player is then faster than enemies. The game has only one chapter so far.
Below are a few screenshots from the game.
